          <div class="col-sm-8 text-left"> 
            <h1 style="font-weight: bolder; text-align: center;">This is how we can ensure the organisation is ready to migrate onto the cloud</h1>
            <h3>Know Your Business' Objectives</h3>
              <p>Avoiding maintenance cost - this means that to save up your time from doing the maintenance and troubleshoots on your physical data centre. Not only that, it also saves your companyâ€™s financial budget from hiring more employees that are skilled in the maintenance fields.</p>
              <p>Increased scalability - in the cloud it is easy for the company to choose which plan suits their data and workloads capacity. In addition to that, you can always increase the cloud scalability whenever you want to do so.</p>
              <p>Improve resiliency - the ability to resize to its original form is one of the best features in migrating to cloud services. It is because it will save up your cloud RAM which will give out better performances and also saves budget from using more of the capacity.</p>
              <p>Increase remote collaboration - when you are in the cloud server, you can collaborate easily in the network with other companies that have the same goals and objectives.</p>
            <h3>Team Potential</h3>
              <p>It is best to have a team that has the skills, experience and knowledge in the cloud server field. More of that, to ensure your team also has the required tools and technologies skills when handling the migration and downtime. On the other hand, the company can provide training courses for their employees from a third party that could help in the end to end configuration of the cloud server. To fill up these empty gaps, it is best to ensure that the team is ready and equipped before having the cloud migration operation.</p>
            <h3>Computing Technologies</h3>
              <p>To take the step further, you need to understand the function and uniqueness of the application. You can use the application the way it is, but there is uniqueness in the cloud server that can be modified by configuration and coding to suit your working environment. Not only that, you have to watch out for the number of consumption and usage that the server takes as it may or may not affect the performance and network traffic of your cloud server. This is why we are required to understand how the technologies work in the cloud as we are also going to work with the software, architecture, management tools and database of the cloud. In addition to that, to ensure that your cloud is working as intended, you need to have a stable network connection which most clouds depend on. With that, you can put into consideration which resource and data you will be migrating to the cloud.</p>
            <h3>Security Environment</h3>
              <h4>Identity and Access Management</h4>
                <p>To ensure that employees and management have different priorities when it comes to accessing the cloud server. because different sections in the cloud have different priorities among the employees in the company. In addition, there are resources and data that are meant to best keep its confidentiality because these resources are being handled and managed by those who are trusted by the company and it should not be handled by others or a third party.</p>
              <h4>Disaster Recovery Mechanisms</h4>
                <p>The cloud server must be able to retrieve the resources and and data that are loss because of disaster. This is to save up time from the company to start over making their resource as it is very crucial to their clients and management. The cloud provider should have a backup storage of their client resource data whether it is a hybrid or set up another backup on another location.</p>
              <h4>Firewall and Endpoint Security</h4>
                <p>To have a multiple layer of firewall in the cloud server is one of the way to prevent and detect attacker that tries to infiltrate the server. While the nedpoint will detect the suspicious activity in the cloud server that may have the malicious attack coming from a third party</p>
              <h2>This is the next step to migrating to the cloud</h2>
                <h3>Operational Readiness</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Employee that handles the cloud-based application</li>
                    <li>The procedure of the cloud technology operation</li>
                    <li>When it comes to business, there must be an agreement within the company to migrate to the cloud services</li>
                    <li>The team must ensure a test run for the best performance</li>
                    <li>Preparation for disaster recovery</li>
                  </ol>
              <h3>Budget</h3>
                <p>In term of budgeting, we need to considers things for example storage unit in the cloud. We must know which plan to be taken for our company. Not only that, we also need to consider increasing in RAM and storage as it can affect the performance in the cloud if it is not enough to handle high traffic bandwidth. Not only that, when we send out our employee, we also need to consider the budget for their trainings and equipment tools, software and security licensing for the server and also maintenance.</p>
